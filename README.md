💸 Expense Management System
📌 Project Overview
The Expense Management System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This tool empowers users to efficiently track and manage their expenses with insightful visual reports and a clean, responsive UI. It is designed for both individual and organizational budgeting to simplify financial management.

Custom Reporting: Generate custom reports based on user-defined date ranges and categories.

🚀 Features
🔐 Authentication & Authorization
User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality.

Role-Based Access: Different levels of access for administrative and regular users.

JWT Integration: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and session management.

🧾 Expense & Category Management
Expense Logging: Create, update, and delete expense entries with details such as date, category, and description.

Category Management: Allow users to manage categories for a more organized expense tracking system.

Document Attachment: Optionally attach receipts or documents to expense records.
